                    Money can be created a couple of ways, one of which is simply banks giving out loans to businesses and indivisuals. Another way that money can be created is by the Federal Reserve (the US Central Bank) going out and buying securities (more recently bonds) in the open market. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As you can glean from the visuals below. You can see that the Federal Reserve has both dropped reserve requirements (cash that banks must have, in their vaults or at the closest Federal Reserve bank, in line with deposits made by their customers) to zero (yes banks do not need reserves anymore) and they have been buying an extreme amount of assets in the open markets. This has both helped keep public companies solvent, and pumped cash into our money supply.

            <p>
            As you can see, traditionally economic disasters are not catalysts for growing the money supply. In the past, situations like the Global Financial Crisis, the issue of liquidity and debt was solved by allowing companies to fail, and others were thrown life boats by people like Warren Buffett.
                <br>
                <br>
            This time, things are different. The government needed to create liquidity in the market immediately and was forced to act swiftly and strongly.

                <p>
                    Well, you would think. Its simple supply and demand right?
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    That is technically right, but the demand is what makes things interesting. Like we mentioned earlier, the Fed is capable of increasing the money supply by purchasing securities in the open market. Currently they are buying loads of bonds which is driving down the interest rates that bonds are recieving. This is pushing people in the direction of puchasing stocks over bonds, moving more money out of the bond market and into the stock market.
                    <br><br>
                    If the Fed was purchasing items like gasoline, houses, and food, we would see likely see inflated pricing for those items, but that is not the case.

                <p>
                    So here we can see the massive amount of Paycheck Protection Program loans that went out early in 2020. They are starting to return to normal levels which is positive for the economy.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Discount Rate is also remaining at all time lows (0.25%) which is giving banks liquidity stability. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As for the Fed's assets on their balance sheet (which can also be seen as cash that has been infused into the economy, since the bonds the Fed buys becomes assets on their balance sheet) we have doubled the amount of assets in the last year... I personally feel that what we will most likely see from this wild ride, will likely be an increase in separation between wealth classes. I believe this will futher widen the wealth gap and benefit the wealthy, but should help stabilize jobs at the same time.
